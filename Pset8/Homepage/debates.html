            <h3>Socrates vs. Plato vs. Aristotle  —  The Ideal State</h3>
            <hr>
            <h6>In this "clash of the ancient titans", the three most famous Greek philosophers take on eachother in the debate on the ideal form of state.
                Who should be in charge of the state? Is it a group of wise philosophers, dedicating their life to governance, as Plato argued in his conception of the "Noocracy"?
                Or is the ideal state a combination of an oligarchy and democracy under law in the form of a constitutional government, as Aristotle argues?
                Or, as Socrates argues, is democracy unfeasible because of the cognitive inability of ordinary people to govern a society?
                All of these questions and more shall be answered to those present at the debate!</h6>

            <h3>Thomas Hobbes vs. John Locke vs. Jean-Jacques Rousseau  —  The State as a Social Contract</h3>
            <hr>
            <h6>In this debate, three icons in and proponents of the tradition of Social Contract Theory debate on the contents of the philisophical contract between the people and the state.
                Does the contract, as Thomas Hobbes argues, imply an absolute ruler in charge of society (a "Leviathan"), to whom all political power is yielded in order to combat the natural state of chaos and violence?
                Or are all men born free, and must this freedom be preserved in a minimal state, whereby the three powers are separated in order to secure this natural freedom, as John Locke argues?
                Or must all political power be a direct reflection of the "general will", whereby a separation of power undermines the realization of this general will?
                Tune in to this debate to have these crucial questions answered!</h6>

            <h3>Karl Marx vs. Mikhail Bakunin — On the "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"</h3>
            <hr>
            <h6>How must he utopian ideal of a socialist society be achieved? In this debate, two pioneers of the left —one of anarchism, the other of communism— discuss their views of the necessary path to a stateless, moneyless society.
                Must the government be overthrown through direct political action, as Marx argues, whereby the working class takes over the state institutions and uses them to establish a "dictatorship of the proletariat"?
                Or must the state institutions be destroyed and political action avoided as a dictatorship of the proletariat is no better than any other dictatorship, as Proudhon argues?
                This and more in the debate!</h6>
