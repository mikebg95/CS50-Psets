# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains the solutions to problem sets 1 until 8 from the course ‘CS50: Introduction to Computer Science’ (2020).

### What is CS50?

An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. As of Fall 2015, the on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, was Harvard's largest course.

Pset1: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/
This problem set was about getting familiar with the language C, using loops and conditions, and printing to and prompting from the command-line. 

Pset2: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/
This problem set focused on using functions, arrays, command-line arguments and getting familiar with variables and their scope.

Pset3: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/3/
The focus of this problem set was algorithms, specifically search and sorting algorithms (linear and binary search; bubble, selection, insertion and merge sort), as well as recursive algorithms. 

Pset4: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/
This problem set focused on pointers and dynamic memory allocation, as well as hexadecimals, call stacks and file pointers.

Pset5: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/5/
The topic of this problem set was data structures, most notably linked lists, hash tables, and tries.

Pset6: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/
This problem set was all about Python and getting familiar with its syntax.

Pset7: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/7/
This problem set focused on SQL and the ways in which it can be used to store and access data.
